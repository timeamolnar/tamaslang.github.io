<p class="message">
  Having 8 years of professional experience in software industry I gained significant knowledge in Java web based application development, design and architecture.
  I designed complex, multilayered systems, implemented projects from sketch with setting up and following high quality standards and achieving maximum customer satisfaction.
<br/><br/>
  I got to know the Scrum methodology four years ago starting a green field project in a Budapest-Frankfurt team.
  Scrum was new to the full organisation back then. It was outstanding to see how efficiently a team using agile principles can perform.
  Encouraged by the success I supported the companyâ€™s agile transformation by initiating and actively contributing in an Agile community.
<br/><br/>
  My main interest lies in designing and developing web based applications, researching new technologies and tools,
  producing clean code, achieving high quality standards, improving processes and helping teams to perform on their best level.
